Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to {dest_city}. The local time {local_time}, and the temperature {temperature}.

For your comfort and safety, please remain seated with your seat belt fastened until we have parked at the gate and the captain has switched off the seat-belt sign.

Take care when opening the overhead binsâ€”items may have shifted during the flight. Before leaving, please check the seat pocket and area around you for any personal belongings.

On behalf of our entire crew, thank you for flying with us today. We look forward to welcoming you on board again soon.
